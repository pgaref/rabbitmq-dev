# README #

A development repository for testing Rabbit MQ functionality.

### Run RabbitMQ Server

## Start the Server
Invoke the sbin/rabbitmq-server shell script. This displays a short banner message, concluding with the message "completed with [n] plugins.", indicating that the RabbitMQ broker has been started successfully.
You can also start the server in "detached" mode with rabbitmq-server -detached, in which case the server process runs in the background.
## Configure the Server
You can customise the RabbitMQ environment by setting environment variables in $RABBITMQ_HOME/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-env.conf. Server components may be configured, too, in the RabbitMQ configuration file located at $RABBITMQ_HOME/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.config. Neither of these files exist after installation.
